                    <li>
                        <p>Kind, bright and intelligent, she seeks to investigate the truth after her kingdom is
                            destroyed and her family is assassinated. Being, in reality, the princess of Northern Liang,
                            she assumed her friend Weiyoung's identity as the illegitimate daughter of Prime Minister
                            Li, in order to be able to avenge her own family as well as Weiyoung. In the process she
                            falls in love with the Emperor's grandson without knowing his status at first, then tries to
                            rebuff him when she realizes who he is. In the end, Weiyoung became Tuoba Jun's wife, and
                            bore him a son. After Tuoba Jun's death ten years after the events in the drama, she became
                            the Empress Dowager with their young son ascending the throne.

                    <li>
                        <p>Bright, sunny and compassionate, Tuoba Jun is the Emperor's favorite grandson as well as the
                            deceased Crown Prince's son. As a result, he is targeted by the Emperor's sons, Tuoba Han
                            and Tuoba Yu. However, he doesnâ€™t care about royal politics. His sincerity and unwavering
                            love towards Weiyoung, despite her desire for revenge, makes her fall for him. In the end,
                            he finally became Weiyoung's husband and together they have a son, and Tuoba Jun ascends the
                            throne as Emperor. Tuoba Jun eventually dies from an illness ten years after the events in
                            the drama.</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>Cunning, ruthless and cold-blooded, Tuoba Yu's greatest ambition is to become the Emperor and
                            rule the world. He is attracted by Weiyoung's intelligence and wit, and plans to use her as
                            a chess piece to realize his ambitions. However, he soon falls for her, and is willing to go
                            to extreme lengths to have her by his side.</p>

                            cousin.</h4>

                    <li>
                        <p>She has been in love with Tuoba Yu since she was young. Having been oppressed and
                            overshadowed by her elder cousin Li Changle from a young age, she becomes ruthless and seeks
                            to topple her cousin. She hides her hypocritical and scheming nature behind her weak and
                            delicate appearance. She treats Weiyoung sincerely at first, but turns against her when she
                            discovered that Tuoba Yu has fallen for her, and as a result she betrays Weiyoung. She
                            eventually becomes pregnant with Tuoba Yu's child. Nearing the end of the series, Changru
                            tries to kill Weiyoung but only resulted in killing Tuoba Yu. She then killed herself out of
                            misery for inadvertently causing Tuoba Yu's death.

                    <li>
                        <p>Known as the #1 beauty in the capital province, she is arrogant and selfish, believing that
                            no woman is better than her. The appearance of Li Weiyoung makes her insecure and jealous.
                            She seeks to get rid of Weiyoung and marry Tuoba Jun on whom she has had a crush for a long
                            time. After she frames Li Weiyoung for the death of the Crown Princess (Tuoba Jun's mother),
                            she eventually becomes the wife of Tuoba Jun. After it was discovered that she was the real
