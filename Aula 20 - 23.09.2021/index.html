            <h2>The Princess Weiyoung</h2>
            <p>During the chaotic Northern and Southern Dynasties, among Northern Liang's royal family lived a princess
                named Feng Xin'er (Tiffany Tang) who was kind, carefree and loved by all. Chiyun Nan, a marshal from the
                Chiyun clan of Northern Wei, was driven by greed to overrun Northern Liang and turned it into a
                bloodbath, killing almost the entire royal family and forcing the princess to survive on her own.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Princess Li Weiyoung, the daughter of the Prime Minister of Northern Wei and his seventh wife, shielded
                the princess from harm. However, Princess Weiyoung was killed by the Chiyun family, of which the Prime
                Minister's first wife, Chiyun Rou, was a member, who were not pleased when she was recalled to the Prime
                Minister's manor. Xin'er assumed Princess Weiyoung's royal identity and resided in the manor, where she
                was disliked and shunned by her younger half-sister Li Changle and her mother Chiyun Rou. She thus took
                it upon herself to fight against the Chiyun clan and became entangled with Northern Wei's prince, Tuoba
                Jun (Luo Jin). She also attracted the eye of Tuoba Yu (Vanness Wu) who saw her as a chess piece to his
                ultimate aim of being Emperor. Through her struggles, she gained wisdom and was finally able to find
                peace for her family while living true to her heart.
