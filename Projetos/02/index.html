        <div class="abouttheauthor" id="tribute-info">
            <p class="content">Sarah Janet Maas was born on March 5, 1986 in New York City, New York. She attended
                Hamilton College in Clinton, New York, where she majored in creative writing and minored in
                religious studies, graduating Magna Cum Laude in 2008. She is married and lives in Pennsylvania.
                Maas is a writer of young adult science fiction and fantasy literature.</p>
            <p class="content">
                Maas began writing what would become her debut novel, Throne of Glass, when she was sixteen years
                old. After writing several chapters of the novel (then titled Queen of Glass), she posted them on
                FictionPress.com, where it was one of the most popular stories on the site. It was later removed
                from the site when she decided to try to publish the novel.
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                In 2008 Maas started sending the story to agents before finding one in 2009. Throne of Glass was
                purchased in March 2010 by Bloomsbury, who later purchased two additional books in the series. The
                series is available in 15 countries and 23 languages. Several prequel novellas set about two years
                before the first novel have also been published. Maas is contracted to write six books in the
                series. The second book of the series, Crown of Midnight is a New York Times young adult
                best-seller.
                The story line of the series is based on Cinderella, with the premise of "What if Cinderella was not
                a servant, but an assassin? And what if she didn't attend the ball to meet the prince, but to kill
                him, instead?"
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                A Court of Thorns and Roses, Maas' second series, is a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast. The
                first book of the trilogy was written in 2009 but wasn't published until 2015. In September 2015 it
                was announced that the Mark Gordon Company had acquired television rights for Throne of Glass.</p>

        <div class="togresume">
            <p class="content"> After serving out a year of hard labor in the salt mines of Endovier for her crimes,
                18-year-old assassin Celaena Sardothien is dragged before the Crown Prince. Prince Dorian offers her
                her freedom on one condition: she must act as his champion in a competition to find a new royal
                assassin.</p>
            <p class="content">
                Her opponents are men-thieves and assassins and warriors from across the empire, each sponsored by a
                member of the king's council. If she beats her opponents in a series of eliminations, she'll serve
                the kingdom for four years and then be granted her freedom.
                Celaena finds her training sessions with the captain of the guard, Westfall, challenging and
                exhilirating. </p>
            <p class="content">But she's bored stiff by court life. Things get a little more interesting when the
                prince starts to show interest in her... but it's the gruff Captain Westfall who seems to understand
                her best.
                Then one of the other contestants turns up dead... quickly followed by another. Can Celaena figure
                out who the killer is before she becomes a victim? As the young assassin investigates, her search
                leads her to discover a greater destiny than she could possibly have imagined.</p>
